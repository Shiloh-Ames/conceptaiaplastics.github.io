            <p>AIA Plastics, Inc.'s plastic welders are Qualified by the American Welding Society (AWS). We can custom weld a variety of plastics into any shape or size.
<p>Plastic Welding is a process of using hot air to heat the material in a sort of "soldering" process. Welding Rod, made from the same material, is then applied to the seam to "bond" the material together.</p></p>

            <h2>Hot Gas Welding</h2>
            <p >Hot gas welding, also known as hot air welding, is a plastic welding technique which is analogous to gas welding metals, though the specific techniques are different. A specially designed heat gun, called a hot air welder, produces a jet of hot air that softens both the parts to be joined and a plastic filler rod, all of which must be of the same material. Hot air/gas welding is a common fabrication technique for manufacturing smaller items such as chemical tanks, process equipment, clean room and mechanical assembles.</p>

            <h2>Extrusion Welding</h2>
            <p>Extrusion welding allows the application of bigger welds in a single weld pass. It is the preferred technique for joining thicker material. Welding rod is drawn into a miniature hand held plastic extruder, plasticized, and forced out of the extruder against the parts being joined, which are softened with a jet of hot air to allow bonding to take place.</p>

            <h2>Polishing</h2>
            <p>Polishing is done on acrylic parts to provide a "glass" like finish to the edges of parts. This process is accomplished by using a combination of hydrogen and oxygen to create a 2400 degree precision flame polishing the edge of the material. For acrylic thicker than .25", AIA Plastics also offers conventional rotary buffing.</p>
